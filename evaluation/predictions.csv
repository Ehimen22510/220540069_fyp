0,"In Queen Mary's University, extenuating circumstances refer to situations beyond a student's control that may negatively influence their ability to engage in or complete assessments, possibly questioning the assessment's validity as a reflection of their achievement. They're typically personal issues or health-related, encompassing both physical health and mental wellness. However, they don't include computer problems, misunderstanding your exam timetable, planned holidays or events, or local transport delays. We operate a 'fit to sit' policy, meaning if you engage in an assessment, you are deemed apt to do so, and extenuating circumstances might not be considered."
