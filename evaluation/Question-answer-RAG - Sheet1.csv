Question,Answer
what are extenuating circumstances?,"Extenuating circumstances are defined by Queen Mary as:

Circumstances that are outside a student’s control which may have a negative impact on a student’s ability to undertake or complete any assessment so as to cast doubt on the likely validity of the assessment as a measure of the student’s achievement.

Extenuating circumstances are usually personal or health problems. Health problems include your emotional wellbeing and mental health, as well as your physical health. Extenuating circumstances do not include computer problems, misreading your exam timetable, planned holidays or events, or local transport delays."
who is the head of school?, The head of School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science is Professor Uhlig
what happens if i submit work late?,"If an assignment is submitted after the specified deadline it shall be recorded as late and a penalty shall be applied, as detailed below. If  there are valid extenuating circumstances then a penalty may be fully or partially waived:
or every period of 24 hours, or part thereof, that an assignment is overdue there shall be a deduction of five per cent of the total marks available (i.e. five marks for an assessment marked out of 100). After seven calendar days (168 hours or more late) the mark shall be reduced to zero, and recorded as 0FL (zero, fail, late)."
What are project meetings?,"Project meetings (second, third and final year, and Masters students)

Some second, third, final year and Masters modules are project-based (e.g. group projects and the final year project). Support for these modules is often in the form of weekly project meetings, either in groups or individually. During these meetings, the student, or group of students, meets with a project supervisor or consultant, who is usually a member of academic staff. This provides the student(s) with an opportunity to summarise progress since the previous project meeting, discuss any problems and possible solutions, and plan the work to be carried out before the next project meeting. The project supervisor or consultant has two main roles: academic, ensuring that the intellectual content of the work is rigorous and well considered, and project management, ensuring that a satisfactory time-plan is formed and followed."
ow are project modules typically assessed?,"Project modules are usually assessed by a project report, an oral examination (viva), and a demonstration of system software where appropriate."
Where can students find details about how different coursework elements contribute to final module assessment?,Students should refer to the module web pages or ask the module organiser for details on how different coursework elements contribute to the final module assessment.
 What is the undergraduate overall module pass mark?,The undergraduate overall module pass mark is 40%.
 What is the postgraduate overall module pass mark?,"The postgraduate, MSc, MEng, and MSci overall module pass mark is 50%."
how do  i register for my module?,Students register for their modules by logging into MySIS (their personal area of SIS) using their usual computer login. They then make preliminary module choices from a list based on the descriptions.
can i change core or compulsory modules,"No, core or compulsory modules will be preselected for students, and they cannot change these modules."
what happens if i submit an exam late?,"Submissions made up to 10 minutes late will incur a 10% deduction from the total available marks. Submissions made more than 10 minutes late will be treated as non-submissions, resulting in a grade of zero."
can i change my Programme, EECS has a strict no-change-of-programme policy. This applies to both requests to change within the school and transfers from other schools to EECS programmes.
What is QMUL's fit to sit policy?,"Queen Mary operates a fit to sit policy, which covers all assessments including coursework and exams. If you sit an exam or submit a piece of coursework you are deemed to be fit to do so. In such instances a request for extenuating circumstances will not normally be considered. If you do not feel you are well enough to attend an invigilated exam then you should not attend and should submit a claim for extenuating circumstances instead. You will need to attend a medical consultation within three days of the date of your exam that you missed. Similarly if you get sick during an exam and have to leave you will need to attend a medical consultation within three days"
how do i submit EC claims,"To submit an extenuating circumstance request you must log a claim through the online extenuating circumstances task on MySIS, following the instructions there. Claims must be submitted by the relevant EC deadline. For in-term assessments, that would be within seven calendar days of the original deadline. For end of semester examinations, the EC deadline would be within seven calendar days of the end of the examination period that the exam took place. Please see our EC submission deadline tool for more info.

A standard EC claim must be accompanied by relevant supporting evidence (for example medical certification, death certificate, police report and crime number, or other written evidence from a person in authority). Please note that although accompanying documentation can be submitted after the claim, claims without any evidence cannot be considered except in the limited cases permitted for self-certification, below. It is in your best interest to provide evidence and supporting documentation that is as comprehensive as possible."
what are tutorials?,"Like labs, some modules use exercise classes in order to give students practical experience of applying concepts discussed during lectures. Classes are usually held in a seminar room, and are often based on pen-and-paper tasks. Teaching Assistants (typically members of staff or postgraduate research students) will be on hand to answer questions and check solutions. The Teaching Assistants will not solve the problem on the student’s behalf, but will try to guide them towards finding a solution themselves. Set tasks are usually assigned in advance, and students should look at them before the class, if possible, and identify any problems, so that they can ask about these during the exercise class. Students should attempt to complete the tasks while help is at hand; if the work cannot be finished in the timetabled exercise class slot, students may finish it in their own time (but without the help of teaching Assistants).

A module will often have several time-slots set aside for exercise classes, and each student will be assigned to a group, which has an individual time-slot. Exercise classes are often run in the Temporary building, or in small seminar or lecture rooms elsewhere in the College. Groups and time-slots for individual modules are usually on QM Plus or individual Timetable. If a student wishes to change groups or time-slots, s/he must have good reason, e.g. a timetable clash. Changes cannot be made for other, more minor reasons; it is the student’s responsibility to be available during timetabled hours in term-time."
